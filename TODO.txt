ToDo-list for the DBSR project, in non-specific order

DBSR:
 - Write a set of (unit) tests for DBSR and helper classes
 - Add option to generate extensive logging (specific rows changed, comparision various callbacks, etc)
 - Add an option for a dry run (which only returns statistics, yet does not writes anything to the DB)
 - Make serialized data replace optional (by adding extra DBSR::OPTION_* constant)
 - Ability to limit the tables / columns / rows being searched (set of DBSR::OPTION_* constants)

DBSR_GUI:
 - Allow casting of input integers or floats combined with an option to enable strict search
 - Add access to all other options of DBSR
