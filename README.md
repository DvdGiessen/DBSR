DBSR: Database Search & Replace
====

DBSR provides functionality for commiting search-and-replace-operations on MySQL databases. It's main advantage above using a simple REPLACE()-SQL statement is the support for parsing PHP serialized strings, which are commonly used in WordPress databases.

Usage
----
For quick usage download the compiled CLI or GUI version from /compiled, and run it from a webserver or (in case of the CLI version) directly from the command line. If you're not sure how to figure it out from there, this might not be for you.
Developers may want to clone the entire repository with the uncombined/unminified version of DBSR, which also allows using the raw classes for direct intergration in your applications.
